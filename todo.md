Logika To-Do
============

* Add helper methods that do not require and ensure invariants

* Add inductively defined datatypes using traits and case classes (with multiple trait inheritance)
 
  * requires modifications on the type checker (assignable based on subtyping)
  
    * assignment
    
    * method call
    
    * equality/inequality ops

* Add match statement for pattern matching traits/case classes

* create examples such as list, nat, etc. as inductive types and prove their properties (ala Coq)
  
* Add first class sequence of trait/case class

* Add type inference (boolean, integer, sequence of integer, uninterpreted function) 
  for predicate logic + algebra sequent to enable auto validity checking

* Add support for multiple program files
